Somebody Write Me A Poem

Somebody write me a poem

Long and sweet

With a rhythm as fine as her hips

Rolling down hills on Route 66

They rise and fall

one breath after another

The country breathing in and out

While rubber smacks tar veins

shooting us forward

We roll up and down the land

Like hands on a body

Or a drummer's beat on skin

And I lay in bed at night thinking

Somebody write me a poem

That feels like sunset,

sitting on the porch

cool glass of lemonade in my hand

Dinner in the kitchen

The smell creeping out the door

to tell me soon I would

eat, drink and be merry

A black Labrador dog

coming up the driveway,

his tail wagging,

and the cocktail in my hand

is not yet a problem.

These are better times,

and again I think,

Somebody write me a poem.

That tells me about my own history.

Painting pictures of activists, gangsters and artists.

People willing to put their freedom on the line,

because freedom was on the line!

The color line -- the Mason Dixon line!

The Friday night basement sessions

with the old mimeograph machine,

it was the Xerox copier before there

ever was a Xerox copier and

it was the printing press of the people bought by schools,

churches and businesses everywhere,

and brought to bear in the '50's fight for Civil Rights.

My 10 and 12-year-old cousins

turning the crank,

young cousin Karen

collating sheets made of truth,

and everyone always said

the truth shall set you free!

At least it got us the right to vote.

Somebody write me a poem

About god and love.

Sex and joy.

How to be spiritual

when all I feel is physical.

Tell me a thousand stories

when the night has quieted down

and I can hear every whisper.

I'll take a deep breath,

feeling the metaphor fully.

And when somebody 

writes me this poem,

I'll read it every day,

a thousand times before bed.

I'll learn it by heart,

teach it to my children,

speak it til my lips turn to dust,

and on my epitaph 

someone will write this poem,

where I'll read it even then.

Somebody write me a poem.

Somebody 

write me a poem.

Somebody write me

a poem.
