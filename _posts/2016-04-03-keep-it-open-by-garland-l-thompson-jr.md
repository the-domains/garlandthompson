Keep It Open
 by Garland L. Thompson Jr. 

Keep it funky,   
keep it Salsa.   
Keep it Mambo Cha Cha Jazz.   
Like Parliament Funkadelic   
and George Clinton's dreadlocks,   
let the groove flow in an outward fashion   
from the center of the you
that is really you,   
and nobody else!
Keep it Swing Jazz Ska,   
keep it Cha Cha Cha.
Bolero and Ravel,
and Ne-Ru-Da!   
We sing it low Sweet Chariot,
and swing it like Harlem streets,   
Sweet Chariot,
like Spanish Harlem streets
and the old market   
on east
a hundred sixteenth street.
Puerto Ree-can-Cu-ban-Domini-can
walkin' alongside Black Man
and Wo-man catching the Lexing-tan Avenue number six train.   
Headin' downtown in the mornin'
like everybody else,   
like Cha Cha Salsa Soul,
no longer running
scared in the shadows,
but runnin' in the mainstream... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2e5503f-4123-4d12-a4f6-f27b5a424861.jpg)

Dig this:   
Senator!   
Can you tell us?   
What are your feelings
on the matter?   
Ladies, and gentleman of the Press,
all I can say is,   
we don't appreciate
being dissed by the House!   
Dissed by the House?
Did he say "Dissed by the House"?   
News flash! Senators dissed by the House!   
Yet we the People are in the House,   
the house of Humanity,   
the house of funky living.   
We are the beats that rhyme with time and syncopation.   
Hey! Change that station to something we can listen to!   
Something we can Salsa Mambo Cha Cha to.   
Something we can Lorca, Langston strut to, and Tupac too,   
for he was there too,
for a minute, for an hour.   
He put in his piece for People Power.   
Did his time on the rhyme,
and thus a thug he is no more   
as he peers back for one last track
from beyond the veil. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1cea2a35-299c-4c61-8f9e-33e26cc0d3e8.jpg)

Keep it open, keep it funky.
Keep it Salsa Mambo Jazz   
blowing waves of focused sound,
blowing funky Mambo grooves   
that move mountains,
or at least mountains of flesh
on a dance floor.   
Keep it funky, keep it open,
Keep it Mambo Cha Cha groovy.   
Keep it Whitman, keep it jazzy
and swing the body electric!   
Keep it Baraka, revolutionary
and for the People!   
Keep it open like Zora Neale
like Langston's poetics,   
Neruda calling out the beat!
He sings keep it funky!   
Keep it funky!
Keep it Mambo Salsa poetry   
beating with your heart.   
He sings keep it sexy, keep it open,
keep it love,   
keep it beauty smiling deep.   
We sing keep it open, keep it open,   
and say you are cordially invited   
to keep your mind
open.
