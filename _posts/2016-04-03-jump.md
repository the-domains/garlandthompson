**JUMP**

The place and time: east 86th street, New York City, 1977\. Teenage boy, me. Adult male, dad. It's a movie theatre we're standing in front of. In an opening day line that snakes up the block. Looking back at all the wild looking counter culture people standing in it just like us Dad jokes as we inch forward. "Man, I should've brought a bunch of joints to sell. I would-a cleaned up!" Having watched my dad and his friends smoke the "evil weed" for years at this point his joke hit home, and we both laugh.

**Jump.**

We're inside the theatre now. Huge movie screen looming up ahead. We sit house left halfway to the front of the theatre. I'm sitting on the aisle, Dad next to me on the left, the place is packed, and there's an electric buzz in the air. It's ripe with anticipation. Last buckets of popcorn are bought and buttered. Last snickers bars and last boxes of junior mints are quickly bought. Last bathroom breaks are taken zoom zoom, and the crowd chats excitedly as we all wait for the show to start.

**Jump.**

"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away from here..." slides up into view setting the stage. The soon to be familiar horns playing the soon to be loved theme music picks us all up, cradling us gently as the soon to be iconic story line is laid out before us against a backdrop of stars upon the silver screen. Suddenly, violent violins, angry tympani drums, and the high pitched whine of something trying to get away are coming from everywhere all at once it seems.

I hear the explosive sound of laser fire, and thanks to the specially designed THX sound system with the big bass speakers running through the theater, I feel the rumble in my chest along with everyone else there that cinematically fateful day. The rumble rumbles on, the tiny rebel ship on the run comes into view, and we all sit transfixed.

**Jump.**

Out of the corner of my right eye sliding into my right periphery is where I first saw it. In what seemed like a moment moving in suspended animation it comes floating forward into frame accompanied by that low rumble that I now know are the cruisers huge star spanning engines. It's in hot pursuit of a tiny rebel ship, it's firing on it, the rebel ship is firing back, and even though I am in a movie theatre watching two dimensional images on a screen I could have sworn I was really sitting in a tiny, ramshackle spaceship looking up to see our doom looming in full view above me. In the blink of an eye George Lucas, and his master craftsmen had re-cast me as a rebel on the run with the Alliance, and there lumbering above our band of ragtag heads was that giant, bulked up, triangular shaped battle cruiser. The evil Galactic Empire was trying to reach down with Darth Vader's black gloved hand to grip our collective throat. Fear rattled my bones, awe overtook my mind, and all I could do was sit there, frozen, white-knuckling my armrests as it passed overhead.

This is a pop culture moment I will never forget.
